# Udacity CVND Landmark Detection and Tracking Project
Repository contains the materials for Udacity CVND Landmark Detection and Tracking (SLAM) project

## About the Project
The goal of the project is to implement SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) for a 2 dimensional world!
A map of an environment is created from only sensor and motion data gathered by a robot, over time.
SLAM gives a way to track the location of a robot in the world in real-time and identify the locations of landmarks such as buildings, trees, rocks, and other world features.
This is an active area of research in the fields of robotics and autonomous systems.
